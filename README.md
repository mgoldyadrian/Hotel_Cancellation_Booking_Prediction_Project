# Hotel Cancellation Booking Prediction Project

## Introduction
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, etc.

## I will try to answer the following questions:
1. How many booking were cancelled?
2. What is the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel?
3. What is the percentage of booking for each year?
4. Which is the busiest month for hotels?
5. From which country most guests come?
6. How Long People Stay in the hotel?
7. Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?

After that, I will make the predictive model to make predictions in the future whether the booking will be canceled or not.
